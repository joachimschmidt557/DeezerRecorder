        <h2>Why?</h2>
        My mother likes Spotify, but it does not work on her old iPod Touch any more. I tried finding a solution to let her record record songs to mp3 and then transfer to her iPod, but none of the solutions I tried worked. But I found Spotify Recorder, and while it did not work it was open source. So I modified it to work with the web player instead, and now my mother is happy again!

        <h2>Is it legal?</h2>
        This probably depends on where you live. For example, in Sweden, recoding songs for private use is legal.
